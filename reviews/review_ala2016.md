The paper is well written and the problem defined properly in introduction and related work sections. The paper mostly evaluates the strengths of its contributions but it does not include what was its limitation. For example, how they can extend this framework to larger and different domains (how it scales), effect of different partial observability, interacting with intelligent preys and so on. Another issue is that accessing to full dynamic of the environment model is not always acceptable, what happen if an adhoc agent has limited knowledge about it?

Another questions that would be good to answer are:
- What would happen if agents can have several roles?  
- When did an adhoc agent place in domain and in which state? (would it be different if you place it in another position than the removed agent?)

Overall, it is a good paper that can be easily followed. They discussed the design and the implementation of their algorithm and the domain properly.

This paper addresses a seemingly difficult problem of adding an adhoc agent that doesn't know the goals of the team, the roles of team members or even the communication protocol. However, this problem become more tractable in their examples as they severely limit the total possible options. The probabilistic method used to address this problem looks sound, and the results are good even though the number of domain options is limited. As mentioned in the paper's conclusion, this method is flexible and could probably be adapted to more open ended domains.
